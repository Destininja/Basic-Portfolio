  </head>About Me</title>
  <body>
    Its a Vet, Its a mom, no its just me!  Although these are a few titles I hold, they just scratch the surface of who I am. So who am I? I am a person who is passionate about making positive impacts at every chance possible. I love discovering new artists and creatives alike, creativity is often lost as we grow older but I believe it keeps us youthful. 
    I love to travel, and by travel I don't mean sitting at a resort laying on a patio chair.  I love to dive into other cultures and explore new places.  I'm that person you call when you want to go on a random adventure and have a good time.
    I have lived in many places the past few years including, Japan, California, Washington DC, South Carolina, North Carolina, and now back in my home state of Texas.
    I am an animal lover, but I'm also a clean freak so I must love most fur babies from afar.
